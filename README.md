# Java 2D Texture Mapper

## Description

This is a 2D Texture Mapper to make maps for 2D games in Java using the built in Java GUI.

## Why was this created?

This was created because I was designing a 2D game in Java and found no easy way to make maps for levels in my game. In Java class I decided it would be cool if you can convert images to csvs and read them into any project easily.
